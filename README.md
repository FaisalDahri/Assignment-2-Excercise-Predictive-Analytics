In this assignment we have a dataset where primarily, we have tried to predict the class column using the features columns in the dataset. For this we use the 'Decision tree' classifcation models.
Then after, using the 'K-mean' clustering algorithm we made clusters of the data points based on similar features. 
We evaluated our decision tree model using different evaluation metrices.
Andd in the end, we discussed the evaluation metrices used in a 'Linear Regression' algorithm.
